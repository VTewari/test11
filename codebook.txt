Code Book - 

This code book summarizes the resulting data fields in  final_tidy.txt .


Identifiers - 

"subject" - The ID of the test subject
"activity_name" - The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken
"activity_number" - The numeric code of the type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken


Measurements - All variable names are mentioned in column " variable" and their values in column called " value"
this list of variables is mentione below.
Please note that the variable names from original files have been modified  by replacing "-","(" & ")" by underscores"_".
